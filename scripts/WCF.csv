1,Of  the Holy Scripture,1,"Although the light of  nature, and the works of  creation and providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God, as to leave men unexcusable;a yet are they not sufficient to give that  knowledge  of  God,  and  of  his will, which  is necessary unto salvation.b  Therefore it  pleased  the Lord,  at sundry times,  and in divers manners, to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church;c  and afterwards, for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of  the flesh, and the malice of  Satan and of  the world, to commit the same wholly unto writing:d  which maketh the Holy Scripture to be most necessary;e those former ways of  God’s revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.f"," a.  Rom. 2:14–15. For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of  the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another. Rom. 1:19–20. Because that which may be known of  God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power  and  Godhead; so that  they are without  excuse.   Ps.  19:1–4.  The  heavens declare the glory of  God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and  night  unto night sheweth knowledge.  There is no speech  nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of  the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun. See Rom. 1:32–2:1.
b.  John  17:3. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.  1 Cor. 1:21. For after that in the wis- dom of  God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.  1 Cor. 2:13–14. … which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of  the Spirit of  God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
because they are spiritually discerned."
